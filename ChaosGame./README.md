The Chaos Game is a method to create fractals using a polygon and a random point within the polygon. The program iteravely generates additional points by finding the midpoint
between the initial point and a random vertice. Eventually, a pattern will form.

The .ppm files are included to be opened in an image viewing program such as GIMP, letting you view the program's creations in a more attractive scene.
